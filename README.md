# AuctionXpert

AuctionXpert is a comprehensive real-time property bidding and management system aimed at
addressing key challenges in the property auction domain. Users can seamlessly register, login,
and search for properties based on type, offer type, and city. The system provides a
comprehensive view of property listings and categories, empowers users to view property
details, make deposits to participate in auctions, and place bids on available properties. The
bidding process is interactive, allowing users to update bid amounts in real-time, fostering a
transparent and engaging auction environment. Additionally, users have the ability to add
properties to their favorites, view a curated list of their favorite properties for easy comparison,
and receive notifications about bid outcomes. To encourage user engagement, AuctionXpert
allows property uploads for auctions, with administrators having the authority to manage
uploaded properties, set bidding start and end dates, and prevent unauthorized changes.
Admin-specific features include the ability to manage other administrators, view user
messages, and oversee various aspects of the system, such as properties, users, bids, and
categories. Furthermore, the system employs automated processes to block users after three
unsuccessful login attempts and update bidding statuses based on auction outcomes. The
development process adheres to the agile methodology, facilitating iterative development and
efficient collaboration. Technologically, the system is implemented using the PHP
programming language, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL database. The development
environment comprises XAMPP, Visual Studio Code, and PHPMyAdmin, ensuring a seamless
and collaborative development process. With a focus on enhancing user access to real-time
property data, ensuring transparency in the bidding process, and maintaining the security of
auction system data, AuctionXpert emerges as a robust solution for timely and informed
decision-making.
